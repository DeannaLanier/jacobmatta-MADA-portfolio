### Library for cleaning 
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(tidyselect)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
```

### Reading in the RDS file 
```{r}
#reading in the RDS file 
datalocation = here("Fluanalysis_exercise","data", "rawdata", "SympAct_Any_Pos.Rda")
rawdata = readRDS(datalocation)

```

### Removing select variables
```{r}
#Remove all variables that have Score or Total or FluA or FluB or Dxname or Activity in their name
#the pipe operator (%>%) allows us to do this in neat fashion while using the contains function
#the negatice sign (-) in front of contains indicates the name inside the parenthesis will be dropped 
#from any variable that has that name 

rawdata2 = rawdata %>% select(-contains("Score")) %>% 
            select(-contains("Total")) %>% 
            select(-contains("FluA")) %>% 
            select(-contains("FluB")) %>%
            select(-contains("Dxname")) %>%
            select(-contains("Activity")) %>%
            select(-contains("Unique.Visit"))

```

### Removing an NA values 
```{r}
rawdata3 = na.omit(rawdata2)
```

### Saving data as an RDS file
```{r}
#saving data as an RDS file in the cleandata folder as "cleandata.RDS"
#used the here function to set the location to where I want to save the file 
location = here("Fluanalysis_exercise", "data", "cleandata", "cleandata.RDS")
```

# See if it worked
```{r}
readRDS(location)
```
