## Background

I am Jacob Matta, a first-year Master of Public Health (MPH) student with a concentration in Biostatistics. I completed my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Georgia (UGA) during the spring of 2021. I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in the Economic Evaluation Research Group in the Health Policy and Management Department at UGA.

## Research Interests

I am interested in engaging in patient-centered research and using quantitative methods to develop clinical outcomes assessments.

## Statistics, Programming and Data Analysis Experience

Last semester I was introduced to Stata, SAS and R through coursework where I learned basic statistics testing and analysis. As a GRA, I used R Studio and Stata to conduct secondary data analyses of data released by Georgia Department of Public Health.

## Goals for MADA

I am hoping this course helps me develop my skills and understanding of R Studio. Specifically, I would like to build efficient strategies to obtain and clean data, run an appropriate analysis, and then be able to communicate the findings to an audience. In addition, I am eager to learn about programming, machine learning, and other modern approaches to data analysis that are the future.

## Fun Fact

Previous to starting the MPH program I was set on attending veterinary school and becoming a veterinarian that specializes in public health. After a semester, my career interest has become more focused to humans but remains in the field of public health.

## Something to Share

I would like to share a link to an episode of The Peter Attia Drive Podcast, in which the host, Peter Attia, discusses neurodegenerative diseases with a neurologist. At the 1 hour and 24 minute mark of the episode, Peter and his guest discuss that early screenings for hearing loss are important because they believe that hearing loss contributes to nuerodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease. If Peter Attia and his guest are correct, then accurate screening strategies are needed to test for hearing loss at earlier stages of life in order to improve prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. This will require new and improved data analysis methods to interpret data correctly and efficiently.
