## Reproduction of a Professional Looking Graph

My professional looking graph of choice is from [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com) is a scatter of NBA players' RAPTOR metric from the 2021-2022 season. For context, RAPTOR is an all emcompassing NBA player statistic designed by FiveThirtyEight that was designed to evaluate player performance. I chose to reproduce this plot because I am an NBA fan myself, that perfers to stay updated on the box scores rather than actually watching the games live.

## Access the Professional Graph

The scatter plot can be found at this [link](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/). After clicking on the link, scroll down to the scatter plot titled "Where every player in the NBA stands, according to RAPTOR".

## Adjusting the Professional Interactive Graph

Since this professional scatter plot I will be recreating is interactive, I will adjust it to visualize players in the 2021-2022 NBA Season who played 1040 minutes or more. Follow the directions below to do so.

1.  Scroll down to the scatter plot titled "Where every player in the NBA stands, according to RAPTOR" if you haven't already
2.  Adjust the interactive graph by selecting the '21-22' and deselecting '22-23' in the options titles "CHOOSE SEASON(S)".
3.  Change the "MINIMUM MINUTES PLAYED" option to 1200 minutes

You should now have an interactive graph that looks like this:

## Attempt at Reproduction

Loading packages

```{r}
library(here) #to set paths
library(readr) #for loading csv files
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

Loading the data

```{r}
data_location <- here::here("data","raptor_by_nba_player.csv")
rawdata <- readr::read_csv(data_location)
```

Examining data

```{r}
head(rawdata)
str(rawdata) #used to see how data is structured 
```

Only interested in player raptor stats in the 2022 season, so I will extract all the observations of the 2022 season

```{r}
#extracting only players in the 2022 season 
rawdata_2022 <- rawdata[rawdata$season == '2022', ]

```

Examining extracted data

```{r}
head(rawdata_2022)
str(rawdata_2022) #used to see how data is structured 
```

I am only interested in plotting players during the 2021-2022 Season who have played 1042 minutes or more

```{r}
#Extracting players from teh 2022 season 
rawdata_2022 <- rawdata[rawdata$season == '2022', ]

#Extracting players that have played 1200 minutes or more 
clean_data <- rawdata_2022[rawdata_2022$mp > 1200,]
```

Using ggplot2 to replicate the data plot produced by FiveThirtyEight that gives a visual of the RAPTOR metric of NBA players who played 1042 minutes of more during the 2021-2022 season

```{r}
#using the clean data set to produce the background to the scatter plot
g1 <- 
  ggplot(clean_data, aes(x=raptor_offense, y=raptor_defense)) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=-10,xmax=0,ymin=-10,ymax=0),fill="pink",alpha=0.01) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=0,xmax=10,ymin=0,ymax=10),fill='turquoise',alpha=0.01) +
  labs(x = "Offensive RAPTOR rating", y = "Defensive RAPTOR rating")+ coord_fixed(ratio=1, xlim=c(-10,10),ylim=c(-10,10))

g1
```

```{r}
#adding data points that have been shaped and colored to match the FiveThirtyEight plot#
g2 <- g1 + geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 1 ) + xlim(-10,10) + ylim(-10,10)
g2
```

```{r}
#Adding annoations to the background
g3 <- g2 + theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +  
  
  annotate(geom="label", x=-9,y=10,label="- offensive", fill="pink") +
  annotate(geom="label", x=-9,y=8,label="+ defensive", fill='turquoise') +
  annotate(geom="label", x=-9,y=-10,label="- defensive", fill='pink') +
  annotate(geom="label", x=-9,y=-8,label="- offensive", fill='pink') + 
  annotate(geom="label", x=9,y=10,label="+ offensive", fill='turquoise') +
  annotate(geom="label", x=9,y=8,label="+ defensive", fill='turquoise') +
  annotate(geom="label", x=9,y=-8,label="+ offensive", fill='turquoise') +
  annotate(geom="label", x=9,y=-10,label="- defensive", fill='pink')
g3
```

## Reflection

The overall process was pretty fun and pushed me to explore the capabilities of ggplot2 functions. I would give myself a solid 85/100 for the end result. The colors of my plot do not exactly match the colors used in the FiveThirtyEight plot. Also, I struggled to make my plot interactive using ggplotly. When I attempted to use ggplotly, the background of my plot was lost. I am sure there is a simple solution to this that I will look into in the near future. Below is an example of using the ggplotly function and the background of the scatter plot disappearing. In addition, I would like to figure out how to edit the interactive dots on the scatter plot to present the player name when selected on.

```{r}
ggplotly(g3)
```
