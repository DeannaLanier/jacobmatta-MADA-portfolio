Only interested in player raptor stats in the 2022 season, so I will extract all the observations of the 2022 season

```{r}
#extracting only players in the 2022 season 
rawdata_2022 <- rawdata[rawdata$season == '2022', ]

```

Examining extracted data

```{r}
head(rawdata_2022)
str(rawdata_2022) #used to see how data is structured 
```

I am interested in plotting Offensive RAPTOR rating (independent variable) vs Defensive RAPTOR rating (dependent variable)
